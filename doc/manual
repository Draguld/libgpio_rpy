If you want used an gpio port,
you need to use for initialize :

void gpioExport(int gpio)
open a new gpio node, (int gpio = the number of gpio port).

after that you can set gpio direction (out, in) (1, 0).
void gpioDirection(int gpio, int direction).

and you can use :

void gpioValue(int gpio, int value) 

for switch the power in the gpio pin.
1 is on and 0 is off.
